  - Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmerâ€™s great choice. Once you learnt         Javascript, it helps you  developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like     jQuery, Node.JS etc.

  - Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any           special environment setup.For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.

  - Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel     and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.

  - JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many             opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.

  - Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job       sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.

## Applications of Javascript Programming

  As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's       presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:

  - Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays       an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

  - Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very     easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

  - User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to         your website visitors.

  - Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other             processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.

  - Presentations - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript           provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.

  - Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is       an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.
  
  - Dynamic drop-down menu
  
  - Displaying date and time

  - Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box)

  - Displaying clocks etc.

## History of JavaScript

In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies andplatforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript cameinto existence.
